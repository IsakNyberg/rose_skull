# Rose Skull
Rose Skull or just skull is a card game usually played with coasters. 

The game rules can be found [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/skull-and-roses/game-rules.php).

This repository is the same game implemented as a website using both Python and JS. Two scrips are used, one to host the web server and one to run the actual game logic. Starting the two servers, joining the webpage with at least 2 players, and typing start() into the JS console starts the game.
